## Standard Workflow
1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to tasks/todo.md.
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
6. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
7. Finally, add a review section to the [todo.md] file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.
8. Do not output code diffs to terminal window.
9. FOllow my instructions.
   *E.g., if I say to install LightWeight Charts v5.0.8, don't install v4.0.
   E.g., if I tell you to run a specific API call to gecko terminal, do not run a different one, or do not run additional API calls thinking it would be good. 
   E.g., if I tell you to delete the console logging for debugging, don't also redirect those logs to the testing component unless I ask you to.
   *You can make a recommendation, but don't do things I don't ask you to, espectially when I explicitly tell you something to do.
